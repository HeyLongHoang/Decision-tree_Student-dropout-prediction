# Decision-tree_Student-dropout-prediction

HiðŸ‘‹, this is our project for the Machine Learning 2022-2 class. Our goal is to predict whether a university student has a high chance 
of dropping out in the future based on his/her information.

We implemented three algorithms and compared the results:
- Decision tree
- Random forest
- Bagging

The data set we use is "Predict students' dropout and academic success" from UCI:
